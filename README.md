# **C Programming: Functions Practice**

## **About This Repository**  
**This repository is dedicated to showcasing the codes and solutions I have practiced while learning and mastering functions in C programming. It contains exercises, examples, and projects designed to deepen my understanding of how functions work and their role in modular programming.**

### **Features**  
- **A collection of C programs focused on functions**  
- **Demonstrations of various types of functions (e.g., recursive, void, parameterized)**  
- **Implementation of problem-solving techniques using functions**  
- **Detailed comments and explanations for each program**

### **How to Use**  
1. **Clone this repository to your local machine:**  
`git clone https://github.com/OrdinaryGuy-18/C-Level-5.git`
